## Description

Repository to collect my notes, build static HTML documentation using MkDocs, and publish them on (GitHub for now) Pages.

Sources are incorporated as Git submodules.


## To Do

- [ ] find a common aesthetic for notes and [Homepage](https://sebastianerfort.github.io)
- [ ] transfer Markdown+YAML linters to stand-alone repo and use them for `pre-commit` hooks (Git or [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/))
