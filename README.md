## Description

Repository to collect my notes, build static HTML documentation using MkDocs-Material, and publish them on (GitHub for now) Pages.

Sources are incorporated as Git submodules.


## To Do

- [x] find a common aesthetic for notes and [Homepage](https://sebastianerfort.github.io)
- [ ] transfer Markdown+YAML linters to stand-alone repo and use them for `pre-commit` hooks (Git or [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com/))


## Alternatives

- [ObsidianPublisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/mkdocs-publisher-template): I used the `mkdocs-publisher-template` to improve and extend my MkDocs based solution
- [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
    > Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers are already using Quartz to publish personal notes, websites, and digital gardens to the web.
    - issues
        - No navigation sidebar? How do you get an overview of contents other than manually creating maps of content and using the graph view?
